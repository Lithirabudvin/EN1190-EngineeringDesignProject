EN1190 Engineering Design Project - August 2024

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Smart Extension Cord is an innovative solution designed to address the challenges of energy management in households. Traditional power strips lack visibility into individual device power consumption and remote control capabilities, leading to energy wastage and inconvenience. This project introduces a smart extension cord that enables power consumption monitoring and remote control of multiple outlets via a smartphone app, promoting efficient energy usage and user convenience.

## üåü Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Remote On/Off Functionality**: Control individual outlets remotely via a smartphone app.
- üìä **Power Consumption Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of energy usage for each connected device.
- üîó **Multiple Outlets**: Manage up to four devices simultaneously.
- ü§≥ **Smartphone App Control**: Intuitive mobile application developed using MIT App Inventor for seamless monitoring and control.
- üî• **Safety and Durability**: Fire-resistant enclosure designed for safety and aesthetics.

## üìã My Contributions

As a key contributor to the Smart Extension Cord project, my focus was on the following areas:

1. **MCU Coding**:
   - Developed the firmware for the ESP32-WROOM-32 microcontroller to handle:
     - Real-time power consumption calculations using ACS712 current sensors and ZMPT101B voltage sensor.
     - Relay control for switching outlets on/off.
     - Wi-Fi connectivity for communication with the Firebase Realtime Database.
     - Real-time data streaming and synchronization with the mobile app.
   - Implemented a web server for initial Wi-Fi configuration, allowing users to input network credentials via a captive portal.
   - Managed data storage and retrieval using Firebase, ensuring hourly power consumption data is logged and accessible.

2. **Mobile App Development**:
   - Designed and developed a user-friendly mobile application using **MIT App Inventor**.
   - Features include:
     - Real-time power consumption display for each outlet.
     - Remote on/off control for individual outlets.
     - Historical power usage visualization.
   - Exported the app as an `Shockers.apk` file for Android devices and provided the `Appinventor/Shockers.aia` project file for further modifications.

3. **Firebase Realtime Database**:
   - Set up and configured the **Firebase Realtime Database** to store:
     - Power consumption data for each outlet, organized by hour and day.
     - Switch states for remote control.
     - Date and time tracking for data aggregation.
   - Structured the database (see `firebase/firebase_database.json`) to ensure efficient data retrieval and updates.
   - Integrated the database with the ESP32 firmware and mobile app for seamless data flow.

4. **Hardware-Software Integration**:
   - Connected the ESP32-based hardware with the mobile app via Firebase, enabling real-time communication.
   - Ensured robust synchronization between physical switch toggles, app controls, and Firebase updates.
   - Tested and debugged the system to ensure reliable operation under various conditions.
